# Phishing Awareness Demonstration Project

## 🎓 Educational Cybersecurity Project

**Course Assignment**: Create a Believable Spoof Website  
**Purpose**: Demonstrate phishing techniques to raise security awareness  
**School**: FCPS Cybersecurity Course

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

This project was created **strictly for educational purposes** as part of a supervised high school cybersecurity assignment. The demonstration website:

- ✅ Was developed in a controlled academic environment
- ✅ Does NOT collect, store, or transmit any user data
- ✅ Includes clear warnings that it is a demonstration
- ✅ Is used only to educate about phishing recognition
- ❌ Should NEVER be used maliciously or without permission
- ❌ Is NOT hosted publicly or distributed outside the classroom

**This project demonstrates security vulnerabilities for EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY under teacher supervision.**

## 📋 Project Overview

This assignment demonstrates how convincingly attackers can replicate legitimate login pages to steal credentials. By creating a visual replica of the FCPS login page, students learn:

- How phishing attacks work
- Visual indicators of spoofed websites
- Importance of URL verification
- Security awareness best practices

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

1. Understand social engineering tactics used in phishing
2. Identify red flags in spoofed websites
3. Recognize the importance of checking URLs before entering credentials
4. Appreciate why organizations implement security training
5. Learn HTML/CSS for interface replication

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (minimal, for visual effects only)
- No backend/database (data is never stored)

### Features Demonstrated
- Visual interface matching
- Form layout replication
- Logo and branding reproduction
- Responsive design
- **No data transmission** - all inputs are discarded

## 📁 Project Structure

```
phishing-demo/
├── index.html              # Main demonstration page
├── styles.css              # Styling to match FCPS login
├── assets/
│   └── images/            # Visual assets (educational fair use)
├── README.md              # This file
└── educational-notice.html # Warning page before demo
```

## 💻 Installation & Usage

### Quick Start

1. **Clone or download this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/phishing-demo.git
   cd phishing-demo
   ```

2. **Open the demonstration**
   - Simply open `index.html` in any web browser
   - No server or installation required

3. **View the educational demo**
   - Try entering any username/password
   - An educational alert will explain the demonstration
   - NO data is collected or stored

### Code Files

The project consists of three simple files:

- `index.html` - Main page with login form and warning banner
- `styles.css` - Styling to replicate login page appearance  
- `script.js` - JavaScript that shows educational alerts (no data collection)

> **Note:** All code is included in this repository. The form submission triggers an educational alert explaining phishing dangers instead of collecting any data.

## 🔍 Security Awareness Lessons

### How to Identify Spoofed Websites

1. **Check the URL carefully**
   - Real: `https://loginportal.fcps.edu`
   - Fake: `https://fcps-login.com` or `https://fcps.login-portal.com`

2. **Look for HTTPS and valid certificates**
   - Click the padlock icon to verify certificate details

3. **Watch for subtle spelling differences**
   - Typosquatting: `fcsp.edu` instead of `fcps.edu`

4. **Be suspicious of unexpected login requests**
   - Phishing emails often create urgency

5. **Never enter credentials from email links**
   - Always navigate directly to the website

## 🚫 What This Project Does NOT Do

- **Does NOT collect usernames or passwords**
- **Does NOT store any information entered**
- **Does NOT transmit data to any server**
- **Does NOT function as actual phishing**
- **Does NOT contain malicious code**

All form submissions lead to an educational page explaining the demonstration.

## 💡 Assignment Fulfillment

This project fulfills the assignment requirements by:

- Creating a visually convincing replica (demonstrates understanding)
- Showing how easily users can be deceived (security awareness)
- Including educational components (responsible disclosure)
- Operating entirely offline/locally (safety)
- Documenting the learning process (academic rigor)

## 🎓 Educational Context

This assignment is part of our cybersecurity curriculum that covers:
- Social engineering
- Network security
- Ethical hacking principles
- Security awareness training
- Responsible disclosure

Students complete this project under teacher supervision with clear ethical guidelines.

## 📖 Presentation Notes

When presenting this project to the class, I will:

1. Explain the educational purpose upfront
2. Demonstrate visual similarities to the real site
3. Show how URL differences reveal the spoof
4. Discuss real-world phishing statistics
5. Provide tips for avoiding phishing attacks
6. Emphasize legal and ethical boundaries

## 🔐 Ethical Guidelines Followed

- Project completed only within assignment scope
- No attempt to deploy or distribute publicly
- No actual credential harvesting attempted
- Clear labeling as educational demonstration
- Teacher approval obtained before development
- Compliance with school acceptable use policy

## 📚 References & Research

- FCPS IT Security Guidelines
- Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG) statistics
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- "The Art of Deception" by Kevin Mitnick (social engineering)
- FBI Internet Crime Report (phishing trends)

## 🏆 Key Takeaways

**For Users:**
- Always verify URLs before entering credentials
- Be skeptical of urgent login requests
- Use password managers that detect spoofed sites
- Enable multi-factor authentication when available

**For Organizations:**
- Security awareness training is critical
- Users are the last line of defense
- Visual indicators alone are insufficient
- Technical controls (MFA, SSO) provide better protection
